Here we try to make one food delivery web application with the maven dependecies.
In this project if someone wants to contribute then he or she is welcome to do that.
I have succesfully connected the JDBC server here and when the user enter the data that data successfully stored on the MYSQL database.
Some works stil need to do here in this project like, payment mode, order tracking, and calculation of the distance between the user and the restaurant.
I will try to update those thing or someone wants to contribute he or she will be welcome for it.
In this project we have use the jsp files for the HTML , css and the javascript code.
In the java code we have use three files controller, Beans, and the model.
In the model file we have declare all the classes of the DATABASE connectetivity, Userdatabase and the the connection required for the register page, sign in page and restaurant page.
